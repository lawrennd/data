biography: |
  My scientific interests are in the field of machine learning and inference from empirical data. This is usually based on statistical regularities, however, I take a particular interest in causal structures that underlie statistical dependences.

  I have worked on a number of different applications of machine learning - in our field, you get "to play in everyone's backyard." For instance, I have been trying to play in the backyard of astronomers and photographers.
