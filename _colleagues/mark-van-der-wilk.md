biography: "I am a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) in the Department of Computing at Imperial College London, researching machine learning. Together with my research group, I work on three central questions:

* How do we find general patterns that allow generalization beyond the training set?

* How can we create neurons that automatically assemble their connectivity structure (architecture), with as little global communication as possible?

* How do we interact with the environment, while avoiding risk but learning as quickly as possible?"
