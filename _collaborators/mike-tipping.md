biography: |
  My early research interests focused on neural computation and probabilistic methods for data visualisation, and later broadened to include more general machine learning methodology and, in particular, Bayesian statistical inference. Between spells in academia, and before joining the University of Bath in early 2016, I spent several years in industry: eight years at Microsoft Research (Cambridge), six years running an independent statistical consultancy and, most recently, two years as Director of Science at Cambridge analytics start-up Featurespace. Over the years I have worked on diverse topic areas, both fundamental and applied, the best-known examples of which are probably the "relevance vector machine" predictive model and the "Drivatar AI" system for Microsoft Xbox franchise "Forza Motorsport".
