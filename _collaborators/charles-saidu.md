biography: |
	I am a computer scientist doing research in AI/ML. I am also interested in enterprise software development. I have a Bachelorâ€™s of technology, a Masters degree and a Ph.D all in computer science.

	My research spans probabilistic parametric/non-parametric models - (e.g, Bayesian DNN, Gaussian processes), Active learning and Software designs. I currently work as a faculty member in the department of computer science at Baze University, Abuja, where I teach and do research in topics relating to Machine learning, algorithms and complexity, optimization, distributed systems and computer programming in various sequential and parallel programming languages. I also provide expert knowledge via consultancy in software development and AI related projects. Prior to that I worked with Bingham university as a faculty member and I have done a few projects on and off the educational space.
