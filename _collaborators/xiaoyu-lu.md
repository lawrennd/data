biography: |
  I'm a machine learning scientist at Amazon, working on various
  topics in Machine Learning/Statistical Modelling. Recently I have
  been working on explainable models to emulate complicated supply
  chain systems. I am proficient with Python, AWS tools including
  cloud computing, SageMaker, State Machine etc.. I am also familiar
  with data analytics tools such as data pipelines and SQL. Prior to
  Amazon I did my PhD in probabilistic machine learning at University
  of Oxford, supervised by Prof. Yee Whye Teh in the Machine Learning
  group at the Department of Statistics, with research experience in
  generative models, Gaussian Processes, MCMC, Bayesian inference,
  deep learning, recommender systems, and reinforcement
  learning. Before my PhD, I did my undergraduate in Mathematics and
  Statistics at University of Oxford with the MMath degree, during
  which I have topped the department in both the bachelor (3rd year)
  and the master year (4th year). My fourth year thesis is on
  Recommender System for movie recommendations using collaborative
  filtering.

  I spent a summer at Microsoft Research, Cambridge as a research
  intern, and worked on a reinforcement learning
  project. Specifically, we use a latent variable model in imitation
  learning to learn different playstyles in games. I also interned at
  Amazon working on Bayesian Optimisation in non-Euclidean spaces. I
  have also enjoyed my internships working as a Quantitative
  Researcher in the financial industry, where I worked on model
  validation and financial derivative pricing models.
