biography: |
  Ciira since October 2011 when he joined my group in Sheffield as a
  post-doctoral researcher (co-supervised with Professor Magnus
  Rattray). Ciira came to us with strong expertise in speech
  processing but adapted quickly to his new role with us which was
  focussed on computational biology.

  In September 2013 he left us to join Dedan Kimathi University of
  Technology where he took up a role as Lecturer in their electrical
  Engineering department.

  Since returning to Kenya Ciira has focussed on deploying machine
  learning models in tandem with internet of things devices, a project
  in close collaboration with ARM. This focus has led to a deployment
  of sensors in bioacoustics for biodiversity monitoring and wildlife
  conservation.
