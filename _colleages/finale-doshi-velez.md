  I head the Data to Actionable Knowledge (DtAK) group at Harvard
  Computer Science.  We use probabilistic methods to address many
  decision-making scenarios involving humans and AI.  Our work spans
  specific application domains (health and wellness) as well as
  broader socio-technical questions around human-AI interaction, AI
  accountability, and responsible and effective AI regulation.  Our
  work falls into three major areas:

  Probabilistic modeling and inference (especially Bayesian models):
  How can we characterize the uncertainty in large, heterogeneous
  data?  How can we fit models that will be useful for downstream
  decision-making?  How can we build models and inference techniques
  that will behave in expected and desired ways?

  Decision-making under uncertainty (especially sequential
  decision-making): How can we optimize policies given batches of
  heterogeneous data?  How can we provide useful information, even if
  we can't solve for a policy?  How can we characterize the limits of
  our ability to provide decision support?

  Interpretability and statistical methods for validation: How can we
  estimate the quality of a policy from batch data?  How can we expose
  key elements of a model or policy for expert inspection?
