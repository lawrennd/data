  title: "Bringing it Together: CS & Math Dual Tutorials"
  descripton: |
    I took over the tutorial system for the CS
    & Maths Dual and created a tutorial program that aims at bridging
    the gap between the CS and Maths courses. We discuss topics at the
    interface and the nature of the two disciplines. We have so far
    discussed Navier Stokes Equations (large scale simulation for the
    weather), $n$-gram models in spelling correction (we will have a guest
    lecture from Daniel Bernhardt of Facebook in this area in November)
    and we have future sessions planned on special maths topics selected
    from John Baez's Google+ feed.
